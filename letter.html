<h2>Gabriela Maria Sanchez. These past two years have been the absolute best of my life, and it's all been because of you.
    I know you didn't want me to spend too much money (LMAO you said that kinda late), so instead of giving you more gifts that reminded me of you, I decided to make you this as a present. Something to pin all of our memories in the past two years and available to be seen by my sweet bunny.</h2>

    <h2> As soon as I saw you at BMOD workshops you had me speechless, and I was too late to make any type of move while we were both near each other. So three years rolled by and the window was finally open and I decided to take a chance. And honestly, it has been the best decision of my life.
    I really don't understand the effect you have on me: The way you move, The way you smile, The way you laugh. It all just makes me feel gushy and crazy all at the same time.
    These past two years have been the best of my life, and I can't wait to see how it all turns out. I love you Gabriela Maria Sanchez.
